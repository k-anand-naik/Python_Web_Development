# ## Setting Up the Python Environment

# To manage Python package versions effectively, create a virtual environment.

# ### Step 1: Create a Virtual Environment
#     python -m venv myPythonEnv

# # Step 2: Activate the Virtual Environment
#     Linux/MacOS = source myPythonEnv/bin/activate
#     Windows = myPythonEnv\Scripts\activate.bat

# # Step 3: Install Required Packages
#     pip install <package_name>
#     ex: pip install Flask

# # Step 4: Create a requirements.txt File --> to get all the packages that are used in the project 
#     pip freeze > requirements.txt

# # Step 5: Install Packages from requirements.txt --> to install all the packages with versions required for the project
#     pip install -r requirements.txt

# # Step 6: Deactivate the Virtual Environment
#     deactivate
